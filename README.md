# Morocco-COVID-19-projections using LSTM networks
This repository is for the [Morocco-COVID-19-projections](https://amineandam04.github.io/Morocco-COVID-19-projections/) website. The website gives projections of covid-19 new cases and deaths for the next 7 days at a national level, or for the next 5 days at a regional level.

In this website you will find forecasts of new reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.Projections are available for both national and regional level. This will enable you not only to have a global idea about projections in Morocco, but also a detailed projections for your region.

In order to produce COVID-19 predictions, we have developed a forecasting model using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models:Long short-term memory (LSTM) network.
